# Tic-tac-toe game using ReactJS

This is one of the fun project i loved doing it . Its a tic-tac-toe game developed using ReactJS. Currently I am learning ReactJS , so this game helped me to know many concept & how to handle it.

In this project , i liked the cocncept of React States and the syntax for Winning Logic . 

This game can be implemented in any language , its seem simple but not ! a small space in css ruined my whole day , but it again helped me the debugging skills!

---->> To check this game just run the react applicaton & then replace the  public & source folder with this src folder!!
